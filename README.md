# Microservices-DotNet6
Currently, microservices are a real craze. Developers around the world are delivering software faster and more scalably thanks to microservices architectures. In this course, you will learn the skills needed to build microservices in C# with .NET 6 and ASP.NET.

The course teaches the core fundamentals of a microservices architecture both in theory (20%) and in practice (80%). This knowledge will be applied in the implementation of microservices with .NET 6 and C#. Initially we will do a quick review of the theoretical foundations of REST, then we will see how to build REST APIs on the .NET platform. After this brief review we will see what microservices are and their most important aspects. Then we will create the first microservices. We will start with a simple project and gradually expand our stack by adding microservices and more complex technologies. In this training we will cover technologies such as:

I - ASP.NET;

II - .NET 6;

III - oauth2;

IV - OpenID;

V - JWT (JSON Web Tokens);

VI - Identity Server;

VII - RabbitMQ;

VIII - API Gateway with Ocelot

IX -Swagger OpenAPI and much more.
